| [8-Week-SQL-Challenge](https://github.com/huonganh245/8-Week-SQL-Challenge) | Data Retrieval and Manipulation, CTEs, Window functions |This repository contains my solutions to the #8WeekSQLChallenge, demonstrating my SQL proficiency.|
| [Analyzing Danish Baby Name Trends](sql/DanishBabyNames.ipynb)  | Data analysis, data cleaning  | I made this project as a fun activity with my friend as she was expecting to have a new baby in 2023 and wanted to have some insights about baby names in her home country. I studied data provided by Statistics Denmark about the names given to newborn children from 1985 to 2022 to understand how Danish baby name tastes changed by investigating trends of popularity.
