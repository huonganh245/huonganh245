| Analyzing Danish Baby Name Trends  | Data analysis, data cleaning  | I made this project as a fun activity with my friend as she was expecting to have a new baby in 2023 and wanted to have some insights about baby names in her home country. I studied data provided by Statistics Denmark about the names given to newborn children from 1985 to 2022 to understand how Danish baby name tastes changed by investigating trends of popularity.|
